### Projects

- **Statistical correction of numerical prediction models**

I have made a statistical adjustment to the numerical forecast model of the National Weather Service. This adjustment consists of calculating and correcting the forecast bias over the last 15 days, running automatically on a daily basis. As a result, it was possible to increase the accuracy of the weather forecasts for maximum and minimum temperatures in Mexico by up to 90%.

- **Extreme maximum temperature warning system**

I have developed a [warning system](https://smn.conagua.gob.mx/es/mapas-de-pronostico-de-temperatura-maxima-extrema) for extreme maximum temperatures in Mexico. To achieve this, I performed an exhaustive analysis of historical temperature data from 1950 to 2022. The objective was to calculate the 95th, 99th and 99.9th percentiles using a regular 7 km resolution grid over the entire Mexican territory. By combining this analysis with the previous project, it is now possible to predict maximum temperatures by region that will fall within 5%, 1% and 0.1% of the warmest recorded data. By issuing this type of alert, preventive measures can be taken to reduce the impact on different strategic sectors of the country.

- **Machine Learning Forecasting for Forest Fires**

I made a forecast of forest fires in Mexico for the 2024 season. Quantile regression trees were used to analyze a data series reconstructed with values from CONAFOR and SMN. The features used to strengthen the model were temporal patterns and climatic variables. The 50 and 95% prediction intervals were also obtained.

- **Dynamic daily report of active forest fires**

I developed a [dynamic dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNTA5YTE4ZTYtZTQ0Mi00YTVmLTg3NGQtOGFiOTIyMGM1OGFiIiwidCI6ImY4M2U0YTc4LWY5Y2UtNGIzZC1hNjZmLTk5ZTUwOTIzNTAyZSIsImMiOjR9) with the daily update made by the National Forestry Commission, which shows the material and human resources assigned to fight forest fires, as well as the number of active fires and their distribution by entity.

- **Dynamic report of historical forest fires in Mexico**
  
  ![Tablero](/assets/img/data_3.png)
  
I have developed a dynamic dashboard showing forest fire activity in Mexico and hectares affected from 2005 to 2023. To create it, I analyzed and cleaned more than 147,000 records provided by the National Forestry Commission. This data was stored in a PostgreSQL database. The dashboard allows you to explore statistics by entity and compare current activity with historical information.
